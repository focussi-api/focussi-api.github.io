Insurance is necessary to protect your interests but can be difficult to manage. We understand the complexities of managing insurance. We reduce the insurance management burden so that you can maximize earnings and get back to running your business.

Focus Solutions is a privately held technology company established in 2004 when Larry Elings saw that motor carriers were struggling to manage insurance for their independent contractors. Since its inception, Focus Solutions has grown from supporting its first customer to providing solutions for hundreds of Motor Carriers, Insurance Companies and Insurance Brokers. We are leaders in developing and maintaining solutions to support our clients’ rapidly changing business needs.

Let us help you manage your contractor’s insurance.
